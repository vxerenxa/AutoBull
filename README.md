The goal of this project is to develop an automatic, real-time darts scoring system using three AI-assisted cameras, a lighting system, and a Raspberry Pi. The system is mounted around the rim of a dartboard ("Dartscheibe") and uses machine learning and computer vision to detect and analyze where darts land. The purpose is to eliminate manual scoring, enhance accuracy, and provide instant visual feedback for players. The solution is compact, intelligent, and ideal for both casual players and competitive environments.
